This python code uses regular expressions to: 
    1) replace the old domain name (abc.edu) with a new domain name (xyz.edu).
    2) Storing all domain names, including the updated ones, in a new file.
    
 Once you set up the script and data repositories, run ./scripts.py.
 Then make sure the new file with updated data is populated.
